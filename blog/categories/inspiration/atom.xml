<h3>Highlights:</h3>

<ul>
<li>The low number of girls and women in programming is a systematic problem, something fundamental is missing</li>
<li>Teenage girls have a massive amount of crazy and creative energy, they <em>should</em> learn to code</li>
<li>Coding is not lonely and it's not mathematical</li>
<li>We are so stuck in semantics and exclusion that we can't function as a community, it's no longer fun and enjoyable</li>
<li>It's up to us to create a new culture of development - one that is fun and focuses on creating and building</li>
</ul>


<h3>My thoughts:</h3>

<p>Linda Liukas <em>thank you, thank you, thank you</em>.</p>

<p>Right now (in technology) girls are rewarded when they fit in with the boys, but what about the girls don't and just want to be <em>themselves</em>? The outlets for them are few and far between.</p>

<h3>Not convinced? Try thinking about it this way:</h3>

<p>There are many girls and women frustrated by their experiences in programming, but men are not equally as frustrated. <em>This means it's not the same situation</em>.</p>

<h3>What can we do to help?</h3>

<ul>
<li>Girls need technological role models (how many female Mark Zuckerbergs can you think of?)</li>
<li>Support organizations that make learning about technology fun</li>
<li>End unprofessional behavior in your workplace (RTFM shaming, sexual/objectifying images or conversations, demeaning jokes).</li>
<li>Talk with a young person about how fun and amazing it is to build web products with wonderful people all day.</li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><blockquote><p>As one of the few female students studying automotive design, I naively felt the need to blend in with my male classmates and find a way to minimize being seen as the only girl. I contemplated signing all of my design sketches as “Chris Park” instead of “Christine Park,” but in the back of my mind I knew it didn’t feel right. My professor offered some great guidance by telling me, “Be who you are.” I learned to embrace the fact that my uniqueness helped set me apart.</p></blockquote></p>

<p><blockquote><p>Today, working in an industry where there are few women, I can bring a different perspective to the table. But, I never want my gender to define me. Instead, my work will speak for itself, and I now know the key is being comfortable in my own skin.</p></blockquote></p>
