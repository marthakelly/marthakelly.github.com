<h3>Highlights:</h3>

<ul>
<li>The low number of girls and women in programming is a systematic problem, something fundamental is missing</li>
<li>Teenage girls have a massive amount of crazy and creative energy, they <em>should</em> learn to code</li>
<li>Coding is not lonely and it's not mathematical</li>
<li>We are so stuck in semantics and exclusion that we can't function as a community, it's no longer fun and enjoyable</li>
<li>It's up to us to create a new culture of development - one that is fun and focuses on creating and building</li>
</ul>


<h3>My thoughts:</h3>

<p>Linda Liukas <em>thank you, thank you, thank you</em>.</p>

<p>Right now (in technology) girls are rewarded when they fit in with the boys, but what about the girls don't and just want to be <em>themselves</em>? There just aren't many outlets for girls who want to do "cute girly coding"*</p>

<h3>Not convinced? Try thinking about it this way:</h3>

<p>There are many girls and women frustrated by their experiences in programming, but men are not equally as frustrated. There are few girls and women pursing technology, but there an abundance of white males. <em>This means it's not the same situation</em>. There's no reason at all that girls who like shoes, nail polish, and miu miu handbags can't build amazing products that get just as much recognition as the boys.</p>

<h3>What can we do to help?</h3>

<p>Girls need more role models (how many female Mark Zuckerbergs can you think of?) and we should all support organizations that make learning about technology fun (for example, <a href="http://railsgirls.com/">Rails Girls</a>).</p>

<p>Please check out <a href="http://railsgirls.com/">Rails Girls</a>, and Linda - thank you.</p>
