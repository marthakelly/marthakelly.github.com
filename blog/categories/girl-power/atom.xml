<h3>Highlights:</h3>

<ul>
<li>The low number of girls and women in programming is a systematic problem, something fundamental is missing</li>
<li>Teenage girls have a massive amount of crazy and creative energy, they <em>should</em> learn to code</li>
<li>Coding is not lonely and it's not mathematical</li>
<li>We are so stuck in semantics and exclusion that we can't function as a community, it's no longer fun and enjoyable</li>
<li>It's up to us to create a new culture of development - one that is fun and focuses on creating and building</li>
</ul>


<h3>My thoughts:</h3>

<p>Linda Liukas <em>thank you, thank you, thank you</em>.</p>

<p>Right now (in technology) girls are rewarded when they fit in with the boys, but what about the girls don't and just want to be <em>themselves</em>? The outlets for them are few and far between.</p>

<h3>Not convinced? Try thinking about it this way:</h3>

<p>There are many girls/women frustrated by their experiences in programming, but men are not equally as frustrated. <em>This means it's not the same situation</em>.</p>

<h3>What can we do to help?</h3>

<ul>
<li>Girls need technological role models (how many female Mark Zuckerbergs can you think of?)</li>
<li>Support organizations that make learning about technology fun</li>
<li>End unprofessional behavior in your workplace (RTFM shaming, sexual/objectifying images or conversations, demeaning jokes).</li>
<li>Talk with a young person about how fun and amazing it is to build web products with wonderful people all day.</li>
</ul>
