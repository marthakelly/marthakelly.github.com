    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><blockquote><p></p></p><p><p>I found that my lack of authenticity actually prevented people from getting close to me.  I wasn’t vulnerable.  I didn’t want others to see my mistakes or flaws, and I did everything I could to cover them up.  I would lie if I thought the truth would hurt.  I even had two online profiles – my work profile and my real profile.</p></p><p><p>And then everything changed.</p></p><p><p>I don’t know if it was an efficiency thing (maintaining 2 separate identities was hard), or if I just decided that I was tired of trying to project “awesome”, and since reality was “pretty darn good” people would just have to accept what I had to offer.  I was going to be me.</p></p><p><p>But to my surprise instead of the world settling for me – they embraced it.</p></p><p><p></p><footer><strong>Kate Matsudaira</strong> <cite><a href='http://katemats.com/authenticity-path-to-success/'>katemats.com/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote></p>
