  <div class="entry-content"><p>You know a bit about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript but do you now how a browser gets and uses these files to display a website?</p>

<p>A browser has a UI (user interface) that most commonly includes an address bar, back/forward button, and reload button. Sometimes developers refer to this as the &#8220;chrome&#8221; (little &#8220;c&#8221;, not Chrome by Google) of a browser. When you navigate to a URL in the address bar you are making a &#8220;request&#8221; for the content at that URL.</p>

<p><img src="/images/google-chrome.png"></p>

<p>That URL you typed maps to an IP address. This is called a DNS lookup. DNS stands for &#8220;Domain Name System&#8221; and it maps numeric computer addresses to human readable names. All computers have an IP address. You can find out your personal computer&#8217;s IP address by typing &#8220;ifconfig&#8221; into your terminal window and looking for the number that is displayed in dot decimal format, such as 000.000.000.000. (Note that 127.0.0.1 is used in your computer internally to refer to itself).</p>

<p>For example, one IP address for Google is 74.125.134.102. You can enter 74.125.134.102 in the address bar and it will show the contents at www.google.com.</p>

<p>Once the browser has the IP address it sends an HTTP request to the web server at that address. HTTP stands for &#8220;Hypertext Transfer Protocol&#8221; and is used to facilitate requests from your client (the browser) and responses from the server. In our case the response is HTML from the web server at www.google.com.</p>

<p>As this HTML response is being sent to your browser, the browser&#8217;s rendering engine is displaying the requested content on your screen. To accomplish this the rendering engine &#8220;parses&#8221; the HTML and creates a DOM tree.</p>

<p>To illustrate this, the rendering engine takes this HTML response:</p>

<pre><code>// Simplified Google.com markup
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; 
&lt;html&gt; 
    &lt;head&gt; 
        &lt;title&gt;Google&lt;/title&gt;  
        &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css" 
            type="text/css" /&gt; 
    &lt;/head&gt; 
    &lt;body class="home"&gt; 
        &lt;h1&gt;Google&lt;/h1&gt; 
        &lt;img alt="Google" src="/logos/google.jpg"&gt;
        &lt;input&gt;
        &lt;button&gt;Google Search&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt; 
&lt;/html&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>And turns it (conceptually) into a DOM tree <em>like</em> this:<br/>
(photoshop is being a PITA! I&#8217;ll try to add an appropriate graph later)</p>

<p><img src="http://www.w3schools.com/htmldom/htmltree.gif"></p>

<p>The browser then parses style data (CSS or inline styles) and together with the HTML it constructs a render tree. The render tree displays rectangles (that represent divs, paragraphs, headlines, etc.) with a few visual attributes such as color and size dimensions. These rectangles are displayed in order on the page. Next, the browser lays out the contents in the position they will appear in the browser. The last step is &#8220;painting&#8221; where the elements are drawn on the screen.</p>

<p>As the browser is rendering the HTML it will find tags (like our link tag and our img tag) that require files from other URLs. The browser will send a request to the web server to get each of these files.</p>

<p>(Note: some interesting things happen in regards to caching but I&#8217;m overlooking them for now. I&#8217;ll include them in a later post).</p>

<h3>Notes About Major Browsers</h3>

<p>Firefox uses the Gecko rendering engine, a Mozilla product. Both Safari and Chrome (and now Opera on mobile?) use Webkit as a rendering engine, which is an open source project. IE uses the Trident rendering engine.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re curious (as I am!) here&#8217;s the world wide browser market share in 2012:</p>

<p>IE, 54.13%<br/>
Firefox, 19.99%<br/>
Chrome, 18.55%<br/>
Safari, 5.21%<br/>
Opera, 1.63%<br/>
Other, 0.49%</p>

<p>That was a quick and dirty overview. As the weeks go on I&#8217;ll dive deeply into each component, even getting down through the deeper layers of the network reference model. If you&#8217;re not sure what that is, you&#8217;ll know soon! (Hint: it&#8217;s how all those 0s and 1s travel over the wires).</p>

<iframe width="640" height="510" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/WOJfUcCOhJ0 " frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p></p>

<p>Natalie Silvanovich is a &#8220;professional hacker&#8221; and Security Researcher. She tests <a href="http://www.rim.com/">RIM</a> products to prevent attackers from getting the information of BlackBerry users. She studied Electrical Engineering in school (although she claims it&#8217;s been a long time since she&#8217;s been in school), and in her spare time she hacks Tamagotchis.</p>

<p>Natalie is super clever, persistent, and funny. Not to mention my main motivation in signing up for <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/eefun">Fundamentals of Electrical Engineering</a> which starts in only 10 days. Now, who wants to take the course with me?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Why, adjusting to (and just soaking in) Etsy life of course! It has been an astonishing amount of time since my last post, and I&#8217;m happy to report it&#8217;s been for great reasons.</p>

<h3>Let&#8217;s catch up</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/nashSTEM/">Nashville Women&#8217;s STEM</a> group is going strong. We&#8217;ve been meeting regularly and have big plans for 2013:</p>

<ul>
<li>Special fundraising to bring in leadership training</li>
<li><a href="http://katemats.com/">Kate Matsudaira</a> blog post discussion series</li>
<li>Open Sourcing an Arduino project guide for young women and men</li>
<li>AP Computer Science test prep for young women</li>
</ul>


<p><strong> BREAKING NEWS!! </strong> I&#8217;m organizing <a href="http://nashville.nerdnite.com/">Nerd Nite Nashville</a>!
What is Nerd Nite you ask?</p>

<blockquote><p>We all know that learning is more fun when you’re drinking with friends and colleagues. Thus, Nerd Nite is a monthly event held in more than 50 cities across the globe during which several folks give 18-21-minute fun-yet-informative presentations across all disciplines – while the audience drinks along.</p><footer><strong>Nerd Nite</strong> <cite><a href='http://www.nerdnite.com'>www.nerdnite.com/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p></p>

<p>Here are a few of my favorite Nerd Nite presentations:</p>

<p></p>

<iframe width="" height="" src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/19716014 " frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>


<p></p>

<p>Do you like 1) drinking with friends and colleagues 2) presenting and nerding out while drinking in front of your friends and colleagues? 3) are near Nashville? If so, email me: <a href="mailto:mk.girdler@gmail.com">mk.girdler@gmail.com</a></p>

<p>Lastly, If you haven&#8217;t already seen this consider it required reading - <a href="http://www.kitchensoap.com/2012/10/25/on-being-a-senior-engineer/">&#8220;On Being a Senior Engineer&#8221;</a> by John Allspaw SVP of Technical Operations at Etsy.</p>

<p>Notable soundbite:</p>

<blockquote><p>You don’t wake up one day and you are “senior” just because your title reflects that upon a promotion. Senior engineers don’t know everything. They’re not perfect in their technical knowledge, and they’re OK with that.</p><footer><strong>John Allspaw</strong> <cite><a href='http://www.kitchensoap.com/2012/10/25/on-being-a-senior-engineer/'>www.kitchensoap.com/2012/10/25/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p></p>

<p>Soon I&#8217;ll be able to write up some technical JS posts, and I&#8217;m starting to dig into <a href="http://www.golang.com">Go</a>. Are you doing interesting things with Go? If so, let me know about it!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m happy to report the first Nashville Women&#8217;s STEM Group meet up was <em>a crazy amount of fun</em>. The highlights included conversations on skepticism, nuclear pharmacy, minecraft (complete with a demonstration), infectious diseases, and really intriguing discussions on our shared experiences as females in technical fields. It was really nice to have a few beers with so many funny, brilliant women.</p>

<h3>talking points for reflection</h3>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not asking for special treatment, but i&#8217;m not one of the guys. It&#8217;s not too much to ask for this consideration.&#8221;</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not very girly, but I&#8217;ve had to act even more girly just to draw the line.&#8221;</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s never the fact that someone said something that one time, it&#8217;s always that one last time that pushes you over.&#8221;</p></blockquote>


<h3>Things I can&#8217;t stop loling over</h3>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;That sign says, &#8216;Our high gravity beer is out of this world&#8217;, I think we should ask them to change that&#8230;&#8221;</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>&#8220;The Committee for Skeptical Inquiry is having a conference in Nashville&#8230;I was doubtful they would ever come here.&#8221;</p></blockquote>


<h3>Next meeting</h3>

<p>Our next meeting is <strong>Nov 14th</strong>, most likely at 12th S Taproom. The interest I&#8217;ve seen from people who couldn&#8217;t make it last time is exciting. I&#8217;m also happy to announce we&#8217;re vetting sponsors, and some really fun events are coming our way in the new year!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My previous post was a bit tongue in cheek, and honestly, it was just so absurd I couldn&#8217;t <a href="http://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/2012/3/8/eb9c0160-78f4-4f08-8a03-34bbdb39a54e.jpg">halp</a> myself but share it with you.</p>

<p>After some reflection this is my actual response. My response to the anonymous idiots? No, friend. This is my response to you. These are a few things I&#8217;d like you to remember if you find yourself in a similar situation as I did in the Coursera forums today.</p>

<blockquote><p>Don’t waste your energy trying to educate or change opinions; go over, under, through, and opinions will change organically when you’re the boss. Or they won’t. Who cares? Do your thing, and don’t care if they like it.”</p><footer><strong>Tina Fey</strong> <cite>Bossypants</cite></footer></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>“So, my unsolicited advice to women in the workplace is this. When faced with sexism, or ageism, or lookism, or even really aggressive Buddhism, ask yourself the following question: “Is this person in between me and what I want to do?” If the answer is no, ignore it and move on. Your energy is better used doing your work and outpacing people that way. Then, when you’re in charge, don’t hire the people who were jerky to you.”</p><footer><strong>Tina Fey</strong> <cite>Bossypants</cite></footer></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sometimes you see an anonymous post on the Internet that makes you 1) spit out your coffee 2) weep silently for humanity 3) hold a kitten while you gain your composure 4) Ask your friends to help you write a hilarious response.</p>

<p>Leave the response you&#8217;d like me to give this person in the comments below.</p>

<p>Is this an exercise in futility? Most definitely. Does it temporarily make me feel better? Absolutely.</p>

<blockquote><p>All of this is completely irrelevant to the class! However, since some feel it’s necessary to call, “sorority girls,” “women” because referring to them as “girls” is disrespectful, and “all about power.” Let’s do a reality check and see if you, “professional women” actually deserve the respect you demand.</p><p>Homo Sapiens Sapiens are a dimorphic species that evolved each gender differently and complimentary to facilitate survival. That arrangement worked successfully for millions of years. Along comes our cooperate masters, who see women not only as a whole new group to whom they can sell their products, (Cigarettes initially) but a whole new potential workforce as well. So, they facilitated the “women’s” movement, and here we are decades later. What was the result? Organizations led by homosexual women, who pat themselves on their bra-burning backs for their accomplishments of getting a little closer to what they really want, which is to be male! Congratulations!</p><p>You also got a decrease in life expectancy, which is getting ever closer to the man’s. Generations of latchkey children growing up in empty homes without their mothers to guide and nurture them as nature designed YOU to do! You bought into the hyper-reality and left our most precious assets to be raised by strangers! Congratulations!</p><p>The consequence of this has been generations of children, who have little or no manners, can’t utter or write an intelligent sentence, have little sense of belonging to anything, and who are consequently no longer competitive in the world. Congratulations!</p><p>Did Dad take over the job of raising the children? Of course not! Women don’t want that either! At the end of the day it is still all the same evolved traits and mechanisms that drive you to find men who have good genes and are good providers and to look down your noses at men who don’t “hunt.” When a woman stays home, she is a mother and housewife. When a man stays home to raise the children he is a bum!</p><p>In the final analysis, you are all nothing more tools for our cooperate masters, who with the promise of power, manipulated you into denying the truth of what you actually are, and into to sacrificing our most precious assets, our children, and consequently our future!</p><p>Now, you girls deserve respect for what again?</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been discovering little oddities in JS lately, and I think it&#8217;s worthwhile to know about them, so let&#8217;s take a look.</p>

<h3>bitwise operators</h3>

<p><a href="http://es5.github.com/#x11.7">Bitwise operators</a> treat operands (the values on either side of the operator) as a sequence of 32 bits (zeros and ones). These operators manipulate the values as binary representations and then return integers.</p>

<p><em>Left Shift Operator ( &lt;&lt; ):</em></p>

<pre><code>x &lt;&lt; y
</code></pre>

<p>Shifts the x to the left by y bits.</p>

<p>Did you know:</p>

<pre><code>x &lt;&lt; y
</code></pre>

<p>is [almost*] the same as</p>

<pre><code>x * Math.pow(2, y)
</code></pre>

<p>Example of usage:</p>

<pre><code>console.log(10 * Math.pow(2, 10)); // logs 10240
console.log(10 &lt;&lt; 10); // logs 10240
</code></pre>

<p>[*truncating happens!]</p>

<p><em>Right Shift Operator ( >> ):</em></p>

<pre><code>x &gt;&gt; y
</code></pre>

<p>Shifts the x to the right by y bits.</p>

<p>Example of usage: You can parse hexadecimal values to get RGB color values</p>

<pre><code>var hex = 'FFEFD5'; // papayawhip
var rgb = parseInt(hex, 16); // value: 16773077

var red   = (rgb &gt;&gt; 16) &amp; 0xFF; // value: 255 
var green = (rgb &gt;&gt; 8) &amp; 0xFF; // value: 239
var blue  = rgb &amp; 0xFF; // value 213
</code></pre>

<p>(there are other bitwise operators in the spec, I&#8217;m just highlighting those interesting me to me here).</p>

<p>Note: JavaScript numbers are technically stored in 64-bits, but are treated as 32 bit when bitwise operators are used.</p>

<p>Also Note: There are a lot of dirty things you can do with bitwise operators, and I do not suggest them. One interesting implementation could be to store boolean flag information, one integer could hold 32 flags!</p>

<h3>converting a string to an integer with + and -</h3>

<p>I definitely do not recommend this, but it&#8217;s worth knowing about in case of extreme debugging.</p>

<pre><code>var wat = +"7", 
    meep = -"7", 
    tinyKitten = +"tiniest of kittens";

console.log(wat); // logs 7
console.log(typeof wat); // logs "number"

console.log(meep); // logs -7
console.log(typeof meep); // logs "number"

console.log(tinyKitten); // logs NaN
console.log(typeof tinyKitten) // logs "number"
</code></pre>

<h3>difference between i++ and ++i (same for decrement)</h3>

<p>++i returns the value of i after being incremented</p>

<p>i++ returns the value of i before incrementing</p>

<pre><code>var i = 0, j = 0;

console.log(++i); // logs 1
console.log(i++); // logs 0
</code></pre>

<h3>! and type casting</h3>

<p>Did you know that the ! operator will cast the type of objects, etc. as boolean?</p>

<pre><code>var kitten = {}, 
    newKitten = !kitten, 
    newerKitten = !!kitten;

console.log(typeof kitten) // logs "object"
console.log(newKitten); // logs false
console.log(typeof newKitten); // logs "boolean"
console.log(newerKitten); // logs true
</code></pre>

<p>Remember the !! is not a new operator, it&#8217;s just the ! (negation) operator twice. It&#8217;s still interesting/strange to me that it would cast the type.</p>

<p>If this kind of thing is interesting to you, I highly recommend reading through the <a href="http://es5.github.com/#x11.4">docs</a> or <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Bitwise_Operators">MDN&#8217;s nice bitwise summary</a>.</p>

<p>Also, I&#8217;d love if you&#8217;d leave your favorite lesser known JS features in the comments!</p>

I refuse to be a turtle—unless it is some really loud species of brave turtle with big ideas. I will not hold back just because I&#8217;m afraid of being called a loudmouth bitch (or a &#8220;trenchmouth loud ass,&#8221; which I was called the other day and as far as I can tell is some sort of pirate insult). Also, I will use the fuck out of the internet, because they can&#8217;t drown you out on the internet. The end.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I wrote a short piece for the lovely Poornima Vijayashanker at <a href="http://femgineer.com">Femgineer</a>, go and check it out if you&#8217;d like to read my thoughts on learning to program!</p>

<h3>Excerpt:</h3>

<blockquote><p>Software Engineering is incredibly rewarding, particularly when you get past the “I don’t understand anything” threshold. You start to see connections and understand the “why” of things and not just the “how.” That’s when you realize programming isn’t as hard as you thought. The most important part is that you stick with it (and it will be hard). You need to realize programming is not an elite club, it’s just most programmers today were lucky enough to be exposed to it at an early age.</p><footer><strong>Martha Kelly Girdler</strong> <cite><a href='http://femgineer.com/2012/09/software-engineering-another-form-of-self-expression/'>Software Engineering Another Form of Self Expression</a></cite></footer></blockquote>
