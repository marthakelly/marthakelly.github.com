I'm Martha. I'm a developer for Cheezburger Network (I Can Has Cheezburger, Failblog, Memebase, Know Your Meme). Well, at least I will be until June. I've been accepted into the summer batch of [Hacker School](http://www.hackerschool.com) and graciously given a grant from [Etsy](http://www.etsy.com). Their goal is to make me "a significantly better programmer." My goal is to exceed their expectations :)

## About me:
* I am infatuated with JavaScript.√è
* My first experience with programming was building a DOS based Star Wars game in 4th grade.
* I was once a debutante (mostly against my will).
* I want to show women/young women that being a programmer is glamorous and fun.
* I graduated Summa Cum Laude from Auburn University.
* Collaborate leadership is my game.

Never graduate ;) <br />
