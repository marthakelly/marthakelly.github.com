Hi, I'm Martha. I'm a developer for Cheezburger Network (I Can Has Cheezburger, Failblog, Memebase, Know Your Meme). Well, at least I will be until June. I'm really excited to announce that I've been accepted into the summer batch of [Hacker School](http://www.hackerschool.com) hosted at [Etsy](http://www.etsy.com). 

{% blockquote %}
Hacker School is a three-month, full-time school in New York for becoming a better programmer. We're free as in beer, and provide space, a little structure, time to focus, and a friendly community of smart builders dedicated to self-improvement.
{% endblockquote %}


I'll spend my summer crunching code in the amazing [Etsy offices in Brooklyn](http://mashable.com/2010/10/13/etsy-office-pics/#view_as_one_page-gallery_box377). Their goal is to make me "a significantly better programmer." 

My goal is to exceed their expectations.

Never graduate! <br />
Martha

p.s.
blog design was hastily put together (I used [Octopress](http://octopress.org)) - it will change constantly :)
