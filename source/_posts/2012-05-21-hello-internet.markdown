I'm Martha. I'm a developer for Cheezburger Network (I Can Has Cheezburger, Failblog, Memebase, Know Your Meme). Well, at least I will be until June. I've been accepted into the summer batch of [Hacker School](http://www.hackerschool.com) and graciously given a grant from [Etsy](http://www.etsy.com). Their goal is to make me "a significantly better programmer." My goal is to exceed their expectations :)

Never graduate ;) <br />
