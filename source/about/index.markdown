I am a web developer & programmer living in Franklin, TN. I'm extremely fond of JavaScript. I'm also extremely fond of writing clean, efficient, and reusable code. 

I created this site to document what I'm learning, to give a little perspective, and to put a dent in the "where are all women in tech?" question.

I'm an advocate of open source, collaborative leadership, and [egoless programming](http://blog.stephenwyattbush.com/2012/04/07/dad-and-the-ten-commandments-of-egoless-programming).

## Inspiration
{% blockquote Sheryl Sandberg, Class Day Speech At Harvard Business School 2012 %} As traditional structures are breaking down, leadership has to evolve as well. From hierarchy to shared responsibility, from command and control to listening and guiding. Youâ€™ve been trained by this great institution not just to be part of these trends but to lead. As you lead in this new world, you will not be able to rely on who you are or the degree you hold.{% endblockquote %}
